# C-A-S-H Material Simulation and Machine Learning Analysis

This repository contains the data, scripts, and models used in the study of C-A-S-H (Calcium-Aluminum-Silicate Hydrate) materials. It includes molecular simulations (MD) for nanoindentation testing, machine learning models for prediction, and statistical analysis of bond lengths and bond angles in silicon-oxygen and aluminum-oxygen tetrahedra.
